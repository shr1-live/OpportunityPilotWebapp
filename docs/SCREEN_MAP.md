# Screen map

Every route in `src/App.tsx`, plus planned screens that have a flow-doc entry but no route. Status mirrors the flow doc and is changed only by `/build-screen` (or `/resolve-oq` when an OQ changes a route). All signed-in routes render inside `AppShell`.

Last updated: 2026-10-06 (design round 3).
