# Sales flow — the app as a sales assistant

The Sales team uses the app to find business opportunities (companies with a problem the product solves; later freelance projects and tenders/RFPs), prepare proposals and emails, approve them in a batch, send, and follow up. Customer-mode research and the first manual sales project/bid/approve API are built; the project screens, provider discovery/placement, tender feeds, proposal/email drafts, sending, and follow-up UI remain pending.

Template fields per entry: Route, Component, What it shows, Actions, State (reads), State (writes), Navigation out, Validation, Status, TODOs. `Status` is flipped only by `/build-screen`. The campaign builder, research run and opportunity screens are the same components as the Candidate flow; their full entries are in `docs/CANDIDATE_FLOW.md` and only Customer differences are listed here. Contracts: built — `../OpportunityPilotWebApi/docs/RESEARCH_CONTRACT.md`; planned — `../OpportunityPilotWebApi/docs/M4_M5_CONTRACT.md` and `../OpportunityPilotWebApi/docs/SALES_CONTRACT.md` (manual sales API slice built; provider, drafts and UI remain). Gap IDs refer to `docs/open-questions.md`.

### Campaign builder — Customer specifics (steps 1–4)

- **Route:** `/campaigns/new`, `/campaigns/:id/edit?step=1..4` (same routes as the Job builder)
- **Component:** `src/features/campaigns/CampaignBuilder.tsx`, `GoalStep.tsx`, `FiltersStep.tsx`, `SourcesStep.tsx`, `ReviewStep.tsx`; logic in `campaignModel.ts`
- **What it shows:** Step 1: mode "Customers — Companies with a problem you solve" (suggested automatically for Product, Business and Services profiles); Customer placeholders ("e.g. EU logistics software companies"). Step 2: Search "Product and search words"; hard filters Geography, Exclude keywords, Exclude organisations (no required skills, work modes or years); scored Industries, Problems you solve ("two or more mentions count as a full match"), Published signals ("absence is unknown, not a negative"); weights Industry 25, Problem 30, Geography 15, Published signals 20, Contact path 10 (contact path is always applied). Step 3: paste blocks start with the company name and accept `Website:`; CSV requires `name`, optional `website`, `country`, `industry`, `description`. Step 4: review lists Geography as a hard filter and Industries / Problems / Signals as scored.
- **Actions:** As in `docs/CANDIDATE_FLOW.md` (Campaign builder steps 1–4). Reset to defaults applies the Customer weights.
- **State (reads):** As in the Job builder; `campaign.mode === 'Customer'` switches labels, criteria, weights and CSV columns.
- **State (writes):** `POST /api/v1/campaigns` / `PUT /api/v1/campaigns/:id` with only Customer criteria (`keywords`, `industries`, `problems`, `locations`, `signals`, `excludeKeywords`, `excludeOrganizations`) and Customer weights; sources and research calls as in the Job builder.
- **Navigation out:** As in the Job builder.
- **Validation:** Same rules as the Job builder (`draftProblems`); no years-of-experience field in Customer mode.
- **Status:** built
- **TODOs:** No tender/RFP or Freelancer.com project sources — only Paste, URL, Feed, CSV (OQ-FE-002). Freelance mode disabled until M7 (OQ-FE-032). Discovery provider not built (OQ-FE-021). "Suggest criteria" (M4) not built (OQ-FE-007).

### Opportunities — List (Customer)

- **Route:** `/opportunities?campaign=<customer campaign id>`, `/campaigns/:id/opportunities`
- **Component:** `src/features/opportunities/OpportunitiesPage.tsx`
- **What it shows:** Same list as the Job entry in `docs/CANDIDATE_FLOW.md`; rows show the company as title/organisation and mode "Customer"; no platform line. Fit uses the Customer criteria. The page states that bulk sending is not offered.
- **Actions:** Same as the Job list: Shortlist / Dismiss / Remove from shortlist / Restore (`PATCH /api/v1/opportunities/:id/status`), filters, sort, Load more, Refresh, Export CSV, open detail.
- **State (reads):** `GET /api/v1/campaigns`; `GET /api/v1/campaigns/:id/opportunities?outcome&status&sort&take=50&skip`.
- **State (writes):** `PATCH /api/v1/opportunities/:id/status`; `GET /api/v1/campaigns/:id/export` (CSV download).
- **Navigation out:** `/opportunities/:id`, `/research/:jobId`, `/campaigns/new`, `/campaigns/:id/edit?step=4`.
- **Validation:** Same as the Job list.
- **Status:** built
- **TODOs:** No selection of several companies for one outreach batch (OQ-FE-001). Copy "every message is approved individually" conflicts with batch approval (OQ-FE-001).

---

### Opportunity — Detail (Customer)

- **Route:** `/opportunities/:id`
- **Component:** `src/features/opportunities/OpportunityDetailPage.tsx`
- **What it shows:** Same layout as the Job detail in `docs/CANDIDATE_FLOW.md`, with Customer differences: the external link reads "Open website"; "Mark contacted" replaces "Mark applied"; no apply-agent notice; fit contributions are Industry, Problem you solve, Geography, Published signals, Contact path; a missing contact path stays visible as Unknown / a gap.
- **Actions:** Shortlist, Dismiss, Mark contacted (shown when status is not Contacted; no confirm), Set status + Update → `PATCH /api/v1/opportunities/:id/status`. Evidence anchors. Back to the list.
- **State (reads):** `GET /api/v1/opportunities/:id`.
- **State (writes):** `PATCH /api/v1/opportunities/:id/status` `{ status }`.
- **Navigation out:** `/campaigns/:campaignId/opportunities`; the company website (http/https only, new tab).
- **Validation:** Buttons disabled while a change runs; Update disabled when the selected status equals the current one.
- **Status:** built
- **TODOs:** No email/proposal draft section, no AI explanation, no activity logging or next actions (OQ-FE-005, OQ-FE-007, OQ-FE-006). "Mark contacted" is a manual status; M5 replaces it with logged activities (`POST /api/v1/opportunities/{id}/activities`).

---

### Outreach — Inbox and draft editor

- **Route:** `/outreach`.
- **Component:** `src/features/outreach/OutreachPage.tsx`.
- **What it shows:** Cross-opportunity drafts with campaign, organisation, channel, recipient verification, state and exact version; filters for campaign/channel/state; editor fields and API-provided send blockers.
- **Actions:** Open and edit (which clears approval), approve/revoke one version, select eligible filtered drafts for batch approval, or copy a draft while recording a Note activity on its opportunity.
- **State (reads):** `GET /api/v1/drafts?state&channel&campaignId&take&skip`, `GET /api/v1/drafts/:id`.
- **State (writes):** `PUT /api/v1/drafts/:id`, per-version approve/revoke, `POST /api/v1/drafts/batch-approve`, and `POST /api/v1/opportunities/:id/activities` for copy audit.
- **Navigation out:** `/opportunities/:id`.
- **Validation:** The API rechecks suppression during create/edit/approval, refuses bracketed placeholders and stale versions, and reports per-item approved/skipped/stale batch outcomes. User-entered recipients remain visibly unverified. Sending remains unavailable until a provider returns a receipt.
- **Status:** built; strengthened review queue built 2026-10-07.
- **TODOs:** Evidence-derived recipient verification, claims/evidence panel, version history and Gmail sending remain (OQ-FE-010).

### Follow-ups — Reminders by due date

- **Route:** `/follow-ups` (currently renders `NotBuiltPage`, milestone label M7; listed in the nav)
- **Component:** today `src/features/placeholder/NotBuiltPage.tsx` via `src/App.tsx:63-73`; planned `src/features/follow-ups/FollowUpsPage.tsx` + `followUpModel.ts`
- **What it shows:** Today: "Follow-ups — Reminders grouped by due date, with opt-outs and suppression respected." and "Not built yet — milestone M7". Planned (`M4_M5_CONTRACT.md` next actions, design `FollowUps.dc.html`): open next actions grouped by due date with the time zone stated, overdue marked, opportunity title and organisation; suppression list.

### Proposal drafts — Proposals for projects, tenders and companies

- **Route:** `/proposals`; editing occurs at `/projects/:id`.
- **Component:** `src/features/sales/SalesProposalsPage.tsx`, `SalesProjectDetailPage.tsx`, pure helpers in `salesModel.ts`.
- **What it shows:** Current manual bid drafts and approved versions across sales projects. Each row shows project, proposal excerpt, exact version, amount, currency, delivery window and approval state. A warning states that nothing is submitted from this screen.

- **Status:** first manual bid/proposal slice built
- **TODOs:** Evidence-backed generated sales proposal drafts, tender handoff, provider placement and batch approval remain (OQ-FE-001/OQ-FE-002).

- **Validation:** (planned) no bid is placed without approval; amounts come from the user, never invented.
- **Status:** first manual project/bid UI slice built
- **TODOs:** Freelancer provider discovery/placement and Freelance mode (OQ-FE-032); provider-backed project ingestion; credentials stay in server configuration (`CLAUDE.md` security rules).

---

### Batch approval — Approve outgoing emails and bids in one step

- **Route:** `/outreach` for message drafts; `/proposals` and project detail for bids.
- **Component:** batch selection is integrated into `OutreachPage.tsx`; sales bid batch API exists but has no combined web queue yet.
- **What it shows:** Eligible drafts in the current filters, selected count, and the approved/skipped/stale result summary.
- **Actions:** Select all eligible filtered drafts or individual drafts, then approve their exact versions in one request.
- **State (reads):** `GET /api/v1/drafts`.
- **State (writes):** `POST /api/v1/drafts/batch-approve`; `POST /api/v1/sales/bids/batch-approve` is available for the future combined queue.
